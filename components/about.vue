            Fosscord aims to give the best possible user experience, while being backwards compatible to Discord's
            features and adding new ones/improving old ones while maintaining the user privacy with end-to-end
            encryption support.

            The client can connect to multiple server instances without the need to open it multiple times.

            The client should be extensible through a secure Plugin and Theme System with own store.

            The server should be extensible through bots, just like discord without the need to change anything except
            the api endpoint.

            The project is open source so everyone can have a look what's going on under the hood and can be maintained
            and expanded by the community.

            Everything is configurable in the server config and everyone can add their own features, so that it is not
            opinionated.

           <br> No disadvantage for the users who use fosscord, so that they can still communicate with all their peers who
            use discord
           <br> Discord has already built a great and stable protocol (don't reinvent the wheel)
            <br>The community can extend and customize their clients and servers by selfhosting them and developing and
            installing addons
